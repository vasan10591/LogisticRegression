![alt tag](https://github.com/vasan10591/LogisticRegression/blob/master/img/LogReg.png?raw=true)

This project demonstrates a very fundemental learning algorithm: [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). Coded using GNU Octave (similar to Matlab), it determines the one-dimensional decision boundary between data falling into two distinct *categories*.
